# SlitTools-Android
Small colelction of tools for Android.
Written in Delphi 11; since a apk won't be less than 8MB with Delphi FireMonkey, I might as well bundle several tools in the same package.
Currently includes:
- Base converter (including roman numerals)
- Password generator (random and speakable)
- Color picker (provides RGB, HEX, HSL, HSL and CMYK)
- Resistor code calculator (4 bands)
- Mileage calculator, metric and imperial inputs (MPG, litres/100km and KPL)
- Number factorisation (NEW, 01/2022)
- Decimal to fraction (NEW, 01/2022)
- Pi calculator (1,500 decimals using BBP formula)

Hopefully more to be added later.
